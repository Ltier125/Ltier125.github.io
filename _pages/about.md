I am **ReitL (Tian Luo)**, an undergraduate student (Class of 2028) pursuing a Dual Degree in **Mathematics & Applied Mathematics** and **Artificial Intelligence** at Sichuan University.

My academic journey is driven by a solid mathematical foundation, a highly self-motivated mindset, and a genuine passion for scientific research. I am particularly interested in the intersection of mathematical modeling and AI algorithms.
